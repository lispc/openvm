# Jekyll Rendering Issue Resolution

## Issue
The markdown files in the `benchmarks` directory were not being rendered correctly on the GitHub Pages website.

## Identification
The issue was identified by running a local Jekyll build and observing that the `single_filter.md` file was not being converted to HTML.

## Resolution
The front matter of the `single_filter.md` file was incorrectly formatted, which caused Jekyll to skip processing the file. The front matter was corrected to:

```yaml
---
layout: default
---
```

After correcting the front matter, a local Jekyll build was successful, and the file was rendered correctly on the GitHub Pages website.

## Verification
The GitHub Pages deployment logs were checked, confirming a successful build and deployment. The markdown files are now correctly formatted and are rendering on GitHub Pages.

## Conclusion
The Jekyll rendering issue was resolved by correcting the front matter in the `single_filter.md` file. This documentation should assist in troubleshooting similar issues in the future.
